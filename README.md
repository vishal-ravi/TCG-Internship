### Differential Expression Analysis of mRNAs in Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) Using R

**Objective:**
The project aims to identify and quantify differentially expressed mRNAs in Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) patients compared to normal individuals. The analysis is performed using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).

**Key Steps:**

1. **Data Acquisition:**
   - Use the `TCGAbiolinks` R package to query and download mRNA expression data for Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma (LIHC) and matched normal samples from TCGA.

2. **Data Preparation:**
   - Process the downloaded data to prepare it for differential expression analysis. This involves converting raw count data into a format suitable for analysis with DESeq2.

3. **Differential Expression Analysis:**
   - Perform differential expression analysis using the DESeq2 package to identify mRNAs that are significantly differentially expressed between HCC and normal samples. This includes calculating fold change values and adjusting for multiple testing.

4. **Results Generation:**
   - Export a CSV file listing differentially expressed mRNAs along with fold change values.
   - Generate visualizations such as volcano plots and heatmaps to illustrate the results of the differential expression analysis.

5. **Reporting:**
   - Compile a report summarizing the analysis, including findings and visualizations, using R Markdown or a similar reporting tool.

**Data Sources:**
- **The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA):** Provides mRNA expression data for HCC (Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma - LIHC) and matched normal samples.
- **cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics:** Offers additional mRNA expression profiles and clinical data, which can be used to complement the TCGA data.

**Deliverables:**
- A CSV file listing differentially expressed mRNAs with fold change values.
- Visualizations (e.g., volcano plots, heatmaps).
- A written report summarizing the analysis and findings.

**Co-developer:**
- Manasvi Ghonge

This project involves using R programming and specific packages for bioinformatics analysis to provide insights into gene expression changes associated with HCC, which can be useful for understanding the molecular mechanisms of the disease and identifying potential biomarkers.
